<h1><b> Super Bowl </b></h1>
<p> The Super Bowl, which is the championship in proffesional American Football, is one of the biggest sporting events in 
America and in the world. The winner of each of the two conferences in the National Football League (NFL) play at a pre-determined location, where most Americans watch either at the stadium or on television. As a result, it is a very good opportunity for companies to advertise their goods and services, making the Super Bowl a huge economic event.</p>

<p> In American football, two teams take turns trying to move the ball by running or passing into the opponent's endzone (called a touchdown). The game lasts for at least 4 intervals (quarters) of 15 minutes each, with halftime being after the second quarter. If the game is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, the game goes into overtime, which lasts until the first team scores (with some exceptions) or if time expires (a tie cannot happen in the playoffs or the Super Bowl). There are multiple ways to score, which includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i> Field Goals </i></li>
  <li><i> Touchdowns </i></li>
  <li><i> Point After Touchdown (PAT) or 2-Point Conversion </i></li>
  <li><i> Safeties (where the opposing team scores two points if you are tackled or fumbled the ball in your own endzone)</i></li>
</ul>
<p> The Super Bowl is important because it is the championship in one of the largest sports in America. Many fans cheer for their respective teams to make it to the big game. Out of the 32 current teams, only 2 can make it to the Super Bowl in a given year, so it is anything but easy. In addition, because of the number of viewers, advertisers try to sell their products in ads and sponserships. They attempt to convince as many viewers as possible to buy their stuff, so they can make a huge profit.
